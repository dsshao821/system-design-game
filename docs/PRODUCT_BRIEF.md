# Product Brief: System Design Game

## Problem
Engineers struggle to build system design skill with passive resources. They need deliberate practice with realistic constraints, measurable outcomes, and rapid feedback.

## Target users
- Interview-prep engineers (IC2–Senior)
- CS students transitioning to backend/distributed systems
- Bootcamp grads with coding skill but weak architecture intuition

## Value proposition
A browser game where users design systems under constraints, run traffic/failure simulations, and learn trade-offs with actionable feedback.

## User outcomes
- Faster requirement decomposition
- Better component selection and data flow design
- Stronger trade-off reasoning (latency, cost, consistency, availability)
- Interview confidence through repeated practice

## MVP scope
### In
- Account + profile
- 3 challenges (URL Shortener, Realtime Chat, Video Streaming)
- Requirements panel with clarifications
- Design canvas (component placement + connection graph)
- Simulation run + metrics dashboard
- Rule-based scoring and feedback
- Save progress + best score per challenge

### Out
- Multiplayer collaboration
- AI-generated custom challenges
- Full coding sandbox
- Mobile-first editing

## Success metrics (first 90 days)
- Activation: 60% of signups complete one challenge
- Engagement: 35% complete 3+ runs
- Learning confidence: 70% report improved system design confidence
- Retention: D30 >= 20%

## Monetization (later)
- Free core + paid pro pack
- Premium challenge packs
- Team classroom/bootcamp licenses
